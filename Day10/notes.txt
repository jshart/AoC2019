1) Need the ability to track state for each pixel - so maybe consider moving to an object rather than int
2) create an "expanding box" search starting on a pixel - any asteroids discovered for the first time, we calculate the relative distance/position to our start pixel, and then mark any asteroids that are obscured by that one.
3) we can do a lazy search of the whole box as we can ignore any pixels already searched (because their state will be tracked)
4) once the box expands to cover the whole image we're done.

repeat for every asteroid in the set. track maximum count. win a gold star.
