reset the code - 
1) setup a known base and pre-calculate the field for that base
 - remove all the search animation etc, precompute all that and present as "first frame"

2) setup a new draw() loop where we run the laser sweep per cycle

can we emulate the laser sweep with a rotating line?

yes - I think we can using Vectors and LERP;
